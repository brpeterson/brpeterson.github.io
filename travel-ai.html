							<h1 class="major">AI Travel Assistant & Planner</h1>
							<h2>Comprehensive travel-planning and booking, all in one place.</h2>
							<p>This conversational Travel Planner, powered by the emergent reasoning capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 in combination with a series of travel APIs, reflects my technical progress and highlights my strongest skills. This project was developed over the course of a couple months, and, in spite of the distinct threat of competition from much larger entities such as Expedia, my project partners and I recognized an opportunity to move quickly on a niche that we identified as somewhat out of line with the traditional style of the big players, and treated this project as a serious product to be launched ASAP. As such, I learned a substantial amount about the business side of software production and gained invaluable knowledge about a variety of concepts and technologies. As the technical cornerstone of a team primarily versed in business, I acted as the sole engineer and developer of this application, and effectively directed discussions on our technical considerations throughout development.</p>
							<h3>Basic React Chatbot Frontend</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/voxel-ai-travelapp-screenshot.JPG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Though I didn't have much web development experience prior to this project, I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and React.js quickly to move our project toward an MVP. I created a basic React frontend for the app, with features such as a cycle of travel-related AI-generated imagery in the background, a scrollable conversation history, and a textbox for sending new messages. GPT-4 responses are streamed directly back to the frontend live, token-by-token, for maximal responsiveness.</p>
							<h3>JS/React Frontend, Python Backend</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I learned how to connect a Javascript/React frontend with a Python backend via Redis, enabling live chatbot functionality with a context of competent travel planning.</p>
							<p>On the backend, GPT contexts are effectively managed, spliced and adapted as needed to optimize conversation costs and response accuracy. Conversation histories are saved live, to be referenced later by users.</p>
							<h3>GPT-4 + Travel APIs</h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Through extensive experimentation, I developed effective methods of empowering GPT with a set of tools with which it was able to successfully advise, plan, and ultimately book a variety of travel-related services and destinations. My work on developing our prompting strategy ultimately enabled our system to effectively utilize a variety of tools, such as hotel and flight APIs via Duffel and Amadeus, while balancing speed, reliability, and cost. Hallucinations were minimal, and our system was able to utilize a variety of tools to assist in a user's travel-planning needs.</p>

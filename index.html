									<h2>AI Travel Assistant - Powered by GPT-4</h2>
									<p>In collaboration with a pair of friends in the W.P. Carey Business School at ASU, I created a conversational interface for what can sometimes be a tedious or intimidating process: travel planning. Powered by the emergent reasoning capabilities of GPT-4, this app functions as a powerful travel assistant, capable of using its vast knowledge in combination with a variety of travel APIs in order to search and book flights, hotels, vehicle rentals, and a variety of activities and points of interest, as well as comprehensively plan trips end-to-end.</p>

									<h2>p5.js Projects: Games, Simulators</h2>
									<p>I've built a wide variety of projects with JavaScript, particularly p5, a visual, animation-focused JS library.
									I created a few games early in my CS journey to learn many programming fundamentals, as well as an election result calculator.
									Later, in collaboration with a group of fellow Ira Fulton Engineering students at ASU, I created a series of games as part of an engineering class project. Thanks to my experience with JavaScript and p5 in particular, I took the lead on this project, directing the structure of the project, and personally taking on the bulk of the more challenging games we decided to build. Our project was a strong success, earning our group an A+, and wowing the class (as one of the most visually advanced projects) during our presentation.</p>

						<h2>Skills</h2>
						<p>A curated overview of my technical and interpersonal skills. From hands-on software development in multiple languages to effective team leadership and adaptive learning, my skill set is both diverse and specialized, crafted over years of projects, collaborations, and continuous learning.</p>

								<i class="icon major fa-solid fa-bars-staggered"></i>
								<h3>Programming</h3>
								<p class="concise-text">I am very experienced in Python, having developed a variety of applications as well as several utility scripts. I've developed interactive games with JavaScript and various Java and C++ programs for both personal and academic purposes.</p>
								<p class="verbose-text" style="display: none;">I have substantial experience with Python, with which I built the backend of my Travel Planner Project, [other projects to be named], and a variety of smaller utility scripts to make my life easier. I've built {a few interactive games and simulators with JavaScript}, and have built {a dozen personal and school-related Java and C++ programs}.</p>

								<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
								<p class="concise-text">I managed a light pollution data project, processing and analyzing images to identify trends using regression and clustering. My findings have influenced local lighting policies.</p>
								<p class="verbose-text" style="display: none;">One of my projects has involved the long-term collection and analysis of light pollution data from all around my region. I regularly process images and night-sky measurements and convert them into raw data, which I organize, analyze, and visualize with regression, clustering, and interpolation techniques to identify trends and anomalies. Through my research, I've successfully characterized the impacts of a variety of lighting policies and made predictions to help inform local decision-making.</p>

								<h3>Web Development</h3>
								<p class="concise-text">I have some experience with CSS, HTML, and React, having developed the front-end for my Conversational Travel Planner App and modified/expanded the features of this site. Always keen to expand my front-end skills.</p>
								<p class="verbose-text" style="display: none;">While web development isn't my primary focus, I've been motivated by personal projects to come to know my way around CSS, HTML, and JS frameworks such as React. I created an MVP interface for my Conversational Travel Planner App (described in the {Projects} section), I modified and added a few additional features to a template to create this site, and am always eager to learn more about front-end development.</p>

								<h3>Prompt Engineering</h3>
								<p class="concise-text">I am very skilled in integrating Large Language Models like ChatGPT into applications, understanding model trade-offs and optimal prompting techniques.
								</p>
								<p class="verbose-text" style="display: none;">As Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have proven themselves increasingly functional, they've become an increasingly significant interest of mine. Implementing them as fundamental components in apps I've built has given me a very strong understanding of the “personalities” of various models, the trade offs between cost and power, and the best prompting techniques currently known.</p>

								<h3>Communication</h3>
								<p class="concise-text">I currently act as a liaison between Data-Processing and other departments at One Fair Wage, translating technical issues into actionable solutions. Additionally, I regularly present on dark-sky advocacy to varied audiences, honing my presentation skills.</p>
								<p class="verbose-text" style="display: none;">In my current position with One Fair Wage, I've acted as the primary connection between the Data-Processing team and both Management and our Database Partner, expressing the needs and friction points the Data Team experiences, working to find solutions that improve our efficiency. It's because of my ability to translate technical concepts and issues into actionable suggestions, as well as my attention to detail, that I serve this function for the non-profit.
								As part of my dark-sky advocacy, I regularly speak in front of a variety of audiences, from groups who have no familiarity, (such as {in collaboration with a friend and artist at a recent Phoenix Convention Center event}), to ASU clubs with some understanding of the issue, to city councils who make the decisions with the most direct impact. My outreach efforts keep my presentation skills sharp.</p>

								<h3>Leadership & Teamwork</h3>
								<p class="concise-text">I have led several group projects at ASU, often driving technical direction while ensuring team inclusivity. Collaborated with business students on an AI Travel Assistant App, bridging technical and business perspectives for mutual growth.</p>
								<p class="verbose-text" style="display: none;">I've worked on many group projects at ASU, which has helped me to develop both my teamwork and leadership skills. I have frequently been the most technically experienced member of my group, so while I've often led discussions on the technical direction of our projects and have made key development decisions, I always do my best to make sure that everyone is on the same page and to help those with less experience to be actively involved.
								I built my AI Travel Assistant App in partnership with a couple of friends in the W.P. Carey Business program at ASU. While I was the most technically experienced member of our team, and led the development of the app, I found the business knowledge my partners had to be invaluable, and we forged a very productive relationship. Each of us benefitted from the knowledge and experience of the others. While my partners focused on funding, copyright, and expenses, I determined the feasibility of our key features, lead meetings on the technical aspects of the app's development, and gained additional skills in translating technical concepts into more practical terms on which business decisions could be made. We gained a greater understanding of the relationship between software development and business.</p>

								<h3>Adaptability & Learning</h3>
								<p class="concise-text">I continuously adapt to new technologies and challenges, most recently delving into the world of Large Language Models. I am passionately motivated by opportunities to learn and evolve.</p>
								<p class="verbose-text" style="display: none;">To build each of my projects and create what I want to create, I've learned new libraries, conventions, and in some cases new languages and frameworks. Changing technologies and new challenges are not only a non-issue for me, they're part of what makes development so exciting. Recent progress in the area of Large Language Models has changed and will continue to change a lot about this field, but it has already inspired me to create interesting and powerful tools (see {Projects}) and I look forward to what the future will bring. The idea of an impressive final product has always been more than enough motivation for me to learn new things, and I suspect it always will be.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Hi, I'm Brad.</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/brad-phx-conv-presentation-pic-hybrid-2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I'm a senior at Arizona State University, working toward my Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I have a passion for programming and building interesting and useful things with technology, as well as for preserving our night sky through the thoughtful management of artificial light at night. I have extensive programming experience, experience working with--as well as leading--teams of different sizes, and pride myself on my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively to many audiences. I have acted as a liason between the Data Team and both management and our data partner in my current position at One Fair Wage, and present regularly on the topic of light pollution in Arizona to a variety of groups of varying familiarity.</p>
							<p>I'm currently involved in a CSE Capstone Project at ASU, in which my group is developing an application to fascilitate more productive communication in medical research through the use of increasingly relevant AI technologies such as large language models and reinforcement learning. I collect and analyze regional light pollution data as part of my ongoing <a href="light-pollution.html">Local Light Pollution Analysis project</a> in which I continue to learn useful data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights to local governments and lighting authorities.</p>
							<p>In my free time, I enjoy gardening, southwestern landscape/astrophotography, cycling, and when the weather doesn't favor the above, I enjoy playing Factorio or Cities: Skylines.</p>
